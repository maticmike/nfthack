Both Matic Mike (and Matic Mike: Evil Club Lords) and Polyfarm are two 100% on chain projects with ERC20 tokens used as in-game currency on the polygon blockchain. Part of the Matic Mike utility is the Dance Royale that was made for entering a battle royale for a small amount of $HGH (ERC20) for a chance to take home the pot.

For the EthGlobal NFTHack, I've decided to extend the functionality to be able to dynamically assign power levels and dynamically add new contracts and projects to the Royale, and custom ERC20s to the Royale to have multi-token battles.

I created Matic Mike in November, and Evil Club Lords at the end of December. The legacy Battle Royale was made in November as well, but this is a major modification and completely custom UI specifically for this hackathon event.
